# Android-Constraint-Layout

Android Constraint Layout is new and most helpful Layout.
Using it we can arrange the UI components as desired and with relative to other.

Using Constraint Layout the Landscape and Portrait mode UI can be made equivalently.

Contarint Layout makes UI design very easy.
Using this we dont need to use multiple Layout one within the other.
This is almost same as ios application design using swift in Xcode.
